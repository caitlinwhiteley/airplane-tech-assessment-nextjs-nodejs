## Overview

This has been a 2 day project to create a basic app that finds planes in the sky. If I had more time, I would focus on making the site more accesible, creating tokens for styling so that I have consistency across all the UI (ie standard margin heights, font sizes, colours, etc), handle the error messages better in my form, and tidy up my code more.
